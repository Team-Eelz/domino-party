Join to the everlasting domino party!

## What is this?
Here, you can do 2 different things:

1. Create: You have one square meter board. Use the editor to populate it with domino tiles and share it with the world. The only requirement is: the last tile must fall.

2. View: Relax and enjoy watching other users creations put one after other creating an infinite tiles falling stream.
