# Frontend

The frontend has being build using the VueJS framework. Nice things to be added:

- Editor: Add an orthogonal camera and screen helper to set the camera position (top, left, ...)
- Editor: Implement spiral stamper.
- Editor: Enable save/load scenes?
- Viewer: Create different collision groups to avoid tiles from one scene can affect tiles from different scene.
- Viewer: Modify physics for the last tile of the scene to only allow forward rotation.
- Both: Add new kind of entities: stairs, ropes, slopes.
- Both: Add support for images for the elements, not just color.
